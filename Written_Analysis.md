# Election_Analysis

##  Overview of Election Audit: 

The purpose of this election audit analysis was to use our given data to find the requested results for Election winners as well as which county had sent in the most votes using our knowledge in for loops, conditional statements and logical operators.

##  Election-Audit Results: 

* There was a total of 369,711 votes cast in the congressional election votes. 
* We are able to see the vote count and percentage of Counties that voted:
 *      Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855) 
        Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
        Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

* The county with the most votes was Denver, with 306,855 votes, making up of 82.8% of the total votes.

* We can also see the vote count and percentages of votes for the candidates:
*       Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
        Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

##  Election-Audit Summary: 

We can modify this script and expand our data to account for more variables in any election. For example, we can use more conditional statements for certain demographics. Basically, by using the same code and tweaking the script, we are able to get, for example, the range of ages that are most likely to vote. No matter the election, we can easily modtify our code in anyway to fit any election needs. Just like how we were able to modift our code in order to find the counties votes and percentages.
